# MAX-MIN-heap-MMN13-20407
MAX-MIN heap project
*.java files are in src/heap

This challenge was given as an assignment in Intro to data structures and algorithms course
a MAX-MIN heam is a heap (full or almost full binary tree) in which:
      every value in an even layer is larger than or equals to any value in other nodes that are beneath it
      every value in an odd layer is smaller than or equals to any value in other nodes that are beneath it
      
This structure comes the actions:
    Build-Heap(A)
    Heapify(A,i)
    Heap-Insert(A,key)
    Heap-extract-min(A)
    Heap-extract-max(A)
    Heap-delete(A,i)
    HeapSort()
    
 There is also the posibility to show the binary tree of values on screen
